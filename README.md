Lightweight server tools for minimal servers. [Contributing to us](./CONTRIBUTING.md)  

[Version Strategy](https://github.com/saltedfishclub/documents/blob/main/Evolution.md)

# Why?

Despite a huge amount of Server Essential Plugins are developed and ready-for-production, we didn't meet any plugin that
has such features:

- **Lightweight** "100+ Functions" are unnecessary for mini servers.
- **Easy for Player** They're players, not machines or developers, which means we need *better UX*.
- **Extensible** It should be extensible, only adding features when we need them.
- **Easy for Admin** We don't need to configure such complex permissions as CMI
- **Easy for Developer** Its easy to make modules and you will enjoy the benefit from module system.

# Build
