# WithMyFriends

Lightweight server tools for minimal servers.

# Why?

Despite a huge amount of Server Essential Plugins are developed and ready-for-production, we didn't meet any plugin that
has such features:

- **Lightweight** "100+ Functions" are unnecessary for mini servers.
- **Easy for Player** They're players, not machines or developers, which means we need *better UX*.
- **Extensible** It should be extensible, only adding features when we need them.
- **Easy for Admin** We don't need to configure such complex permissions as CMI

# Build

WithMyFriends is modular.

Build Library for other plugins(without basic function):

```
./gradlew buildLibrary
```

Build Full Version:

```
./gradlew buildFullPlugin
```
